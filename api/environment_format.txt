// You will need to setup .env files for local development.
// These should NEVER be committed to the source repo as that would expose credentials for backend services.
// Create '.env.staging' in the same folder as this file, then populate each with the following variables

DB_HOST={uri for db host}
DB_PORT={port that host is listening on}
DB_NAME={main db name}
DB_USER={user name for db connection}
DB_PASSWORD={password for db connection}
PORT={optional: the port this server will listen on, default: 3000}
